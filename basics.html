                <p class="fs-4">In this section, you will learn how to install the correct software
                in order to run python on your computer.

                <h1> Comments in Python </h1>
                <br>
                <p class = "fs-4"> In this section, you will learn about python statements, and how to 
                correctly identify when to use them. 
                <p>Comments are important because they describe why a piece of code was written. They can be written side by side of a block of code explaining what that code does, or on top of the code block. A great part of comments is that the python interpreter ignores the comments when it is executed. There are two types of comments in python. One is the single line comments, and the second is the multiple line comment. 
                </p>
                <p> In python, a single line comment can be written using a (#) hash symbol, followed by the comment. </p>
                <p>For example: </p>
                <img src = "C:\Users\Public\Pictures\comments-1.jpg" class = "rounded img-fluid" width = "400" height = "200">
                <p>Comments spanning multiple lines can be written to describe what the following lines of codes do. They can be written using three quotations (“‘) and closing statements (’’’) at the end. </p>
                <p>For example: </p>
                <img src = "C:\Users\Public\Pictures\comments-2.jpg" class = "rounded img-fluid" width = "400" height = "200">
                <hr>
                <h2>Uses of Python comments</h2>
                <ol>
                    <p><li>Makes code more readable</li></p>
                    <p>Writing code makes the code more understandable. It also makes it easier for other programmers working on the same project as us. </p>
                    <p><li>Debugging purposes</li></p>
                    <p>When working on a program, and we get an error, we can comment the line of code that is getting an error instead of removing it completely. </p>

                <h1> Python Data types</h1>
                <br>
                <p class = "fs-4"> In this section, we will learn about the different
                data types in python, and how to correctly use them.
                <h2>Numeric Data Type</h2>
                <p>In python numeric data types are used to hold numeric values. Some numeric data types include integers, floats, and complex numbers. </p>
                <p>Types of numeric data types: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Integer holds integers of non-limited length </p></li>
                    <li>Floats hold decimal point numbers, and it is only accurate up to 15 decimal places.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Complex holds complex numbers</p></li>
                </ol>
                <hr>
                <h2>List Data Type</h2>
                <p>A list is an ordered collection of similar or different types of items separated by commas, or enclosed within brackets.</p>
                <p>For example: </p>
                <img src = "C:\Users\Public\Pictures\comments-6.jpg" class = "rounded img-fluid" width = "400" height = "200">
                <p>Accessing elements in a list</p>
                <p>To access elements in a list, we use the index number, 0, 1, 2 </p>
                <img src = "C:\Users\Public\Pictures\comments-7.jpg" class = "rounded img-fluid" width = "400" height = "200">
                <hr>
                <h2>Tuple Data Type</h2>
                <p>A tuple sequence of items which is the same as a list. The main difference between a list and a tuple is that tuples are mutable.</p>
                <p>Tuples are created using parentheses. </p>
                <p>Accessing Elements in a tuple: 
                <p>It is very similar to accessing elements in a list. We use the index number
                of the tuple to access the elements. </p>
                <p>For example: </p>
                <img src = "C:\Users\Public\Pictures\tuples-1.jpg" class = "rounded img-fluid" width = "400" height = "200">
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>String Data Type</h2>
                <p>Strings are sequences of characters that are represented by either single or double quotes </p>
                <p>String indexing is very similar to lists. You can access specific characters in a string by accessing the string' indexes. </s></p>
                <p>For example: </p>
                <p>Concatenating python strings 
                When concatenating 2 string variables, you can use the operator (+) </p>
                <p>For example: </p>
                <img src="C:\Users\Public\Pictures\strings-2.jpg" class = "rounded img-fluid" width = "400" height = "200">
                <p>Output: </p>
                <img src="C:\Users\Public\Pictures\strings-3.jpg" class = "rounded img-fluid" width = "400" height = "200">
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Set Data Type</h2>
                <p>Set is an unordered collection of unique items. Set is defined by values seperated
                by commas inside braces { }.</p>
                <p>For example: </p>
                <img src="C:\Users\Public\Pictures\set-1.jpg" class = "rounded img-fluid" width = "400" height = "200">
                <p>Output:</p>
                <img src="C:\Users\Public\Pictures\set-2.jpg" class = "rounded img-fluid" width = "400" height = "200">
                <hr>
                <h2>Dictionary Data Type</h2>
                <p>Python dictionary is an unordered collection of items. It stores elements in key/value pairs</p>
                <p>The keys are unique identifiers that are associated with each value</p>
                <hr>
                <h1> Type conversions in python</h1>
                <br>
                <p class = "fs-4"> In this section, we will learn about the type conversion in python
                <hr>
                <p>In programming, type conversion refers to the process of coverting 
                data from one type to another. For example, converting integer to string. </p>
                </p><p>There are two types of type conversions in python</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Implicit Type conversion</li></p>
                    <p>Implicit type conversion is automatically performed by the python interpreter</p>
                    <p>Converting integer to float</p>
                    <img src="C:\Users\Public\Pictures\conversion-1.jpg" class = "rounded img-fluid" width = "400" height = "200">
                    <p>In this example, you can see we started off with an integer and a float number. When we added these two numbers together, we found that we got a float. </p>
                    <p>Python automatically converts integer data types to floats, as it converts smaller data types to larger data types to avoid the loss of data</p>
                    <img src="C:\Users\Public\Pictures\conversion-2.jpg" class = "rounded img-fluid" width = "400" height = "100">

                    <li><p>Explicit conversion</p></li>
                    <p>Explicit conversion is also called type casting because the data types of the objects are converted by the user.</p>
                    <img src="C:\Users\Public\Pictures\conversion-3.jpg" class = "rounded img-fluid" width = "400" height = "200">
                    <p>In this example, the string was converted into an integer. When converting the string to an integer, we are able to add both variables and then we got 44</p>
                    <img src="C:\Users\Public\Pictures\conversion-5.jpg" class = "rounded img-fluid" width = "400" height = "200">
